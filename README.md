# Data Science skills
In this repository I have added my machine learning and deep learning homeworks, that can help
you get a comprehension of my skills and my knowledges in these topics. 

### Machine Learning Folder
You can find classical machine learning notebooks and notebooks with basic tools/libraries in Machine Learning folder. Kind of tasks: gradient descent, random forest, knn, feature engineering, etc.
**Stack:** Pandas, Numpy, sklearn, matplotlib.

### Deep Learning Folder
There are deep learning notebooks and notebooks with basic dl libraries in this folder. The first notebook is about basic NN structure and Pytorch, the second one is about image classification with my own models (architecture with BasicBlocks from resnet but adjusted to 64x64 images) and pretrained large models (vision transformer). The third work is about text classification with embeddings.
